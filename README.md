#INFO343 final-project
For the final project, we need to creat an app based on the Firebase and React.

This app is meant to facilitate community-building by giving users the infrastructure to both combine resources and barter for goods and services. Someone with only a few dollars of disposable income per week might need to save up for months to afford new shoes or to fix a broken appliance, but if many people pool their resources, they can take turns buying what they need. We plan for this app to be usable by low income communities around the world, not just in the United States.

Since this app is first and foremost about building a sense of community between people without much to spare, we also support in-group chatting and bartering . We hope to ameliorate language barriers by allowing users to select their preferred language and provide them the option to use google translate to automatically translate other languages used in chat into their language of choice. We also plan to provide users a way to find the item on their wishlist as cheaply as possible. This particular feature will be hard to internationalize (every country has their own eBay-equivalent), so for this feature, we’ll focus on the case of American users for the purposes of this assignment.

Our research didn’t turn up any similar apps; this seems to be a problem that isn’t well solved at the moment. Personal shopper apps exist, but they tend to target high-end users, and none integrate bartering or fund sharing which are features uniquely beneficial to the group we intend to service.
